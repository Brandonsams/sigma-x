Here is a plan for the initial piece of functionality that is intended to be created and implmented via this app and api:

Give API a number via a post request, and determine if the number is prime.

Check a database for previous results, so that repeated calculation isn't done.

Respond with an json object that represents what it took to determine the primality of the number in question.
- Number
- Time that request was received
- Time response sent
- request/response processing time
- isPrime
- primeFactorDecomposition
